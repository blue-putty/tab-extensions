#### ‚ùå &nbsp; Firefox

* You can build the extension from source (from this repo) and load it locally.

**We aim to support every major browser.** We continue to advocate for change in the browsers that restrict new tab page functionality, because we believe everybody should be able to raise money for charity as they browse the web.

### Developing
